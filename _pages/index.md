Hello! I am currently a postdoctoral research fellow at the [Simons Laufer Mathematical Sciences Institute](https://www.slmath.org/). Prior to this, I completed my PhD in Probability theory from [Eindhoven University of Technology](https://www.tue.nl/), under the supervision of [Prof. Remco van der Hofstad](https://rhf.win.tue.nl/) and Dr. Rajat Subhra Hazra. My doctoral thesis is titled "Stochastic Processes on Preferential Attachment Models".

I am working on Random Graphs. Besides this, my areas of interest are Stochastic Processes, Random Interfaces, Random Walks, Statistical Physics, and Applied Probability Theory.

Here is something other than my academics. I love to play table tennis, chess, football (though I am terribly bad at this).  I like to read storybooks and comics. Here I am a bit choosy. Regarding the books based on society, I like to read those in Bengali as I can relate them to my surroundings which I have seen since my childhood. And whenever I can't relate it, I loose interest in reading it.  And I love travelling. I want to see the whole world. I am a foodie also. I like to taste the special food items of every place I visit.
